            [1] China posted a $1 trillion trade surplus. The CPC continues to focus on supply-side stimulus, further exacerbating overcapacity, which exports deflation around the world. With no immediate threats to global supply chains and tapered fiscal spending, it's reasonable to assume a disinflationary environment.

            [2] Day by day, Elon continues to discredit his own myth â€” a myth that so many worked tirelessly to construct. Idol worship is an unforgivable sin; for your god is a jealous god. Full Self-Driving already exists; it's called Uber. BYD's vehicles are better and cheaper. Climate change has been undermined by AI dominance. The NASDAQ is currently selling TSLA at $400 for $2.04 of earnings per share.

            [3] The potential for regime change in Venezuela should be taken more seriously. With the world's largest oil reserves, the Monroe Doctrine 2.0, illegal immigration, and drug trafficking, it's only a matter of time before the U.S. capitalizes on this.
