            [1] Big Oil is beautiful. In a world full of waste, fraud and abuse - it's oil that will never lie to you; what you see is what you get. Exploration, extraction, refinement, distribution and marketing serve as the framework of the world's most robust business. At its core; hierarchy and discipline. A single business will employ hundreds of thousands of workers; providing them with high wages, security and purpose. Standard Oil for a thousand years.

            [2] Private equity and credit sure are private. I don't know what they're up to, but my gut tells me something's off. I don't know when, but I do know that when it does happen, they'll be responsible. Not much more to say on this.

            [3] The world is changing so rapidly - everything is up for grabs. Temperance is foundational for surviving. As shown in the allocation below, I have a proclivity towards U.S money. The newly confirmed Treasury Secretary of The United States seems to agree - his personal financial disclosures showed a majority allocation to the U.S Money Market.
